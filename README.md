# Tic-Tac-Toe Game Project

This repository contains a Java-based Tic-Tac-Toe game developed as part of the CS 2210b Data Structures and Algorithms course assignment. This enhanced version of the classic game allows for a customizable board size and win condition, and features an AI opponent that uses a recursive algorithm to determine its moves.

## Features

- **Customizable Board Size:** Users can define the size of the Tic-Tac-Toe board (n x n), making the game more versatile and challenging.
- **Variable Win Condition:** The game can be configured to change the number of consecutive tiles (k) required to win, adding complexity to the strategy.
- **Intelligent AI Opponent:** The computer opponent evaluates potential moves using a recursive algorithm, considering future possibilities to make strategic decisions.
- **Efficient Game State Management:** Utilizes a custom hash table with separate chaining to store game states, improving the AI's decision-making process by avoiding redundant calculations.
- **Interactive User Interface:** Provides a simple and intuitive interface for players to interact with the game, including dynamic board display and input validation.
